By default,\nemacs provides an executable `ctags` that would conflict with the\nexecutable of the same name that ctags provides. To prevent this,\nHomebrew removes the emacs `ctags` and its manpage before linking.\nHowever, if you install emacs with the `--keep-ctags` option, then\nthe `ctags` emacs provides will not be removed. In that case, you\nwon't be able to install ctags successfully. It will build but not\nlink.\n","requirements":[],"options":[{"option":"--without-xml","description":"Compile without libxml2"},{"option":"--with-jansson","description":"Build with jansson support"},{"option":"--with-libyaml","description":"Build with libyaml support"}],"bottle":{}}
