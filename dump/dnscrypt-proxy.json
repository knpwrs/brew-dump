You can do this by going to\nSystem Preferences > \"Network\" and clicking the \"Advanced...\"\nbutton for your interface. You will see a \"DNS\" tab where you\ncan click \"+\" and enter 127.0.0.1 in the \"DNS Servers\" section.\n\nBy default, dnscrypt-proxy runs on localhost (127.0.0.1), port 53,\nbalancing traffic across a set of resolvers. If you would like to\nchange these settings, you will have to edit the configuration file:\n  /usr/local/etc/dnscrypt-proxy.toml\n\nTo check that dnscrypt-proxy is working correctly, open Terminal and enter the\nfollowing command. Replace en1 with whatever network interface you're using:\n\n  sudo tcpdump -i en1 -vvv 'port 443'\n\nYou should see a line in the result that looks like this:\n\n resolver.dnscrypt.info\n","requirements":[],"options":[],"bottle":{"stable":{"rebuild":0,"cellar":":any_skip_relocation","prefix":"/usr/local","root_url":"https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles","files":{"high_sierra":{"url":"https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/dnscrypt-proxy-2.0.9.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz","sha256":"d346d5ebe3fb651196f89979321bdb9a03148c58a452cfa43c55fc0ca151eb2e"},"sierra":{"url":"https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/dnscrypt-proxy-2.0.9.sierra.bottle.tar.gz","sha256":"169878ff7817c70295068effc7ea386e8f5856d96b0a0a77e37a6d72f05e6c61"},"el_capitan":{"url":"https://homebrew.bintray.com/bottles/dnscrypt-proxy-2.0.9.el_capitan.bottle.tar.gz","sha256":"bbf0dda01a76b9bc1a38afa6da34e7e4915dbd6ddad7caa8fafc6a5328e3f855"}}}}}
